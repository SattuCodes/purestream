    <h2>Proper Sanitation</h2>
    <p>Proper sanitation is a fundamental component of public health and plays a crucial role in preventing diseases. Access to safe and clean toilets and latrines allows for the appropriate disposal of human waste, reducing the risk of contamination and the spread of waterborne illnesses such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid <br><br>1. The benefits of proper sanitation extend beyond health; it promotes dignity, safety, and education, particularly for women and girls. It also contributes to economic development by reducing healthcare costs and increasing productivity <br><br>2. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, recognizing that clean water and sanitation are essential for other areas of development, including nutrition, education, and gender equality <br><br>3. By improving sanitation, we can make significant strides towards a healthier, more sustainable world forÂ everyone.</p>
